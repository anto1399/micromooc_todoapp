# MicroMOOC Technical Assignment
MicroMOOC Internship Project Documentation

This is a simple TODO app that enables users to perform CRUD operations and can see all active and completed.
I implemented full User Authentication for this application supporting, login, registration, change password etc.
The admin dashboard is also customised to enable TODO CRUD operations
It was built with  Django Framework using BootStrapp for some basic UIs

# Requirements:
1. Developed with Latest Django Version 2.2.1
2. Python Version Used 3.7.0
3. Pipenv was used for managing Python packages, and is the latest recommended by Python.org.
4. I Used Simple SQLite Database because the app is very simple and no extesive configurations are required.


# Installation
1. Clone the repository into your desired locations on your computer.
2. Install pipenv (If you do not have it installed) with pip: pip install pipenv.
3. Change to the cloned repository and install the required packages for the application: pipenv install requests.
4. Wait for pagckages to finish installing and start server: python manage.py runserver.
5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and see login or register to create your todos.

To Just Try, You can login with:

The Project is also hosted on HEROKU via the URL (Sorry about the UI, I have not configured the static files properly):
